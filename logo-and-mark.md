# Logo and mark guidelines

Use either the Vipps logo or the Vipps mark when showing Vipps as a payment option. Choose the option that best matches the way in which other payment options are displayed.

See the [Vipps MobilePay Design Toolkit on Figma](https://www.figma.com/@vippsmobilepay) page to download the logo and mark.

## Logo

*Use the Vipps logo with other brand logos.*

If you're using the full logos of other brands to indicate different payment options in your payment flow, use the Vipps logo instead of the Vipps mark. Display "Vipps" in text next to the logo, if you're doing so for other brands. Don't alter the Vipps logo in any way. Use only the logo provided by Vipps.

## Mark

*Use the Vipps mark with other brand identities in credit card format.*

If you're using brand identities displayed in credit card format to indicate different payment options in your payment flow, use the Vipps mark instead of the Vipps logo. Display "Vipps" in text next to the mark, if you're doing so for other brands. Don't change the color or weight of the mark's outline or alter the mark in any way. Use only the mark provided by Vipps.

## Size recommendations

Adjust the height to match the other brand identities displayed in your payment flow. Don't make the Vipps logo or mark smaller than other brand identities.
