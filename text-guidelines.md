# Text guidelines

You may use text to indicate Vipps or MobilePay as a payment option and to promote these in your marketing communication.


<Tabs
defaultValue="vipps"
groupId="brands"
values={[
{label: 'Vipps', value: 'vipps'},
{label: 'MobilePay', value: 'mobilepay'},
]}>
<TabItem value="vipps">


Always use an uppercase "V" followed by lowercase letters. Don't capitalize the full name "Vipps" unless matching the typographic style on your website. Never use all capitals for the *Vipps* in your marketing communication.

The *Vipps*  name should be set in the same font and typographic style as the rest of the text on your website. Don't try to mimic the Vipps MobilePay typographic style.
