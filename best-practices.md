# Best practices

Maximize your conversions with checkout flows that enable customers to quickly and easily review their payment information and confirm their purchase.

<Tabs
defaultValue="vipps"
groupId="brands"
values={[
{label: 'Vipps', value: 'vipps'},
{label: 'MobilePay', value: 'mobilepay'},
]}>
<TabItem value="vipps">

## Make Vipps the primary payment option

People like using Vipps for faster checkout. Where possible, display the Vipps button prominently, and consider making it the default or only payment option.

## Let your Vipps customers make purchases without an account

Account creation slows down the checkout process and can lead to abandoned carts. Use Vipps to enable faster guest checkout. If you'd like your customers to create an account, allow them to do so after they complete their purchase.

## Include Vipps on confirmation pages and receipts

When displaying payment information on confirmation pages and email receipts, make sure you indicate the customer has paid with Vipps. Ensure that *Vipps* is displayed consistently with how other payment methods are displayed.
